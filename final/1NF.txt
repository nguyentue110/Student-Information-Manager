========================================
1NF — First Normal Form (Premium Version)
========================================

A relation is in 1NF if:
    • All attributes contain atomic (indivisible) values
    • There are no repeating groups
    • Each table represents a single entity type

In this step, the original UNF data has been separated into clean entity tables.
Primary Keys (PK) and Foreign Keys (FK) are identified for each relation.

----------------------------------------
1) STUDENTS
----------------------------------------
Attributes:
    StudentID
    FirstName
    LastName
    DOB
    Gender
    Address
    Phone
    Email
    EnrollmentYear
    Major

Primary Key (PK):
    StudentID

Foreign Keys (FK):
    None

Justification:
    • StudentID uniquely identifies each student.
    • All attributes describe only that student.
    • No repeating groups; all values are atomic.

Conclusion:
    STUDENTS satisfies 1NF.


----------------------------------------
2) SUBJECTS
----------------------------------------
Attributes:
    SubjectCode
    SubjectName
    Credits

Primary Key (PK):
    SubjectCode

Foreign Keys (FK):
    None

Justification:
    • Each subject is uniquely identified by SubjectCode.
    • SubjectName and Credits are atomic values.
    • No multi-valued attributes.

Conclusion:
    SUBJECTS satisfies 1NF.


----------------------------------------
3) LECTURERS
----------------------------------------
Attributes:
    LecturerID
    LecturerFirstName
    LecturerLastName
    LecturerEmail
    Office

Primary Key (PK):
    LecturerID

Foreign Keys (FK):
    None

Justification:
    • LecturerID uniquely identifies each lecturer.
    • All columns describe lecturer attributes and are atomic.

Conclusion:
    LECTURERS satisfies 1NF.


----------------------------------------
4) CLASSES
----------------------------------------
Attributes:
    ClassID
    SubjectCode
    LecturerID
    Semester
    Year
    MaxCapacity

Primary Key (PK):
    ClassID

Foreign Keys (FK):
    SubjectCode → SUBJECTS(SubjectCode)
    LecturerID → LECTURERS(LecturerID)

Justification:
    • ClassID uniquely identifies each scheduled class.
    • Each class must be associated with exactly one subject and one lecturer,
      establishing two foreign key relationships.
    • All fields contain atomic values.

Conclusion:
    CLASSES satisfies 1NF.


----------------------------------------
5) ENROLLMENTS
----------------------------------------
Attributes:
    EnrollmentID
    StudentID
    ClassID
    Grade
    GradeLetter
    Note

Primary Key Options:
    Option A (recommended for 1NF simplicity):
        EnrollmentID
    Option B:
        (StudentID, ClassID)

Foreign Keys (FK):
    StudentID → STUDENTS(StudentID)
    ClassID → CLASSES(ClassID)

Justification:
    • Each enrollment links one student to one class.
    • Grade-related attributes are atomic.
    • No repeating groups.

Conclusion:
    ENROLLMENTS satisfies 1NF.
